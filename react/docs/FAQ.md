##Project Information

###What do the scripts in package.json do?
Unfortunately, scripts in package.json can't be commented inline because the JSON spec doesn't support comments, so I'm providing info on what each script in package.json does here.  

| **Script** | **Description** |
|----------|-------|
| start | Runs tests, lints, starts dev webserver, and opens the app in your default browser. |
| lint:tools | Runs ESLint on build related JS files. (eslint-loader lints src files via webpack when `npm start` is run) |
| clean-dist | Removes everything from the dist folder. |
| remove-dist | Deletes the dist folder. |
| create-dist | Creates the dist folder and the necessary subfolders. |
| prebuild | Runs automatically before build script (due to naming convention). Cleans dist folder, builds html, and builds sass. |
| build | Bundles all JavaScript using webpack and writes it to /dist. |
| test | Runs tests (files ending in .spec.js) using Mocha and outputs results to the command line. Watches all files so tests are re-run upon save. |
| test:cover | Runs tests as described above. Generates a HTML coverage report to ./coverage/index.html |
| test:cover:travis | Runs coverage , however sends machine readable lcov data to Coveralls. This should only be used from the travis build! |

### Can you explain the folder structure?

### Where are the files being served from when I run `npm start`?
Webpack serves your app in memory when you run `npm start`. No physical files are written. However, the web root is /src, so you can reference files under /src in index.html. When the app is built using `npm run build`, physical files are written to /dist and the app is served from /dist.

### Where is index.html?
It's generated by webpack using htmlWebpackPlugin. This plugin dynamically generates index.html based on the configuration in webpack.config. It also adds references to the JS and CSS bundles using hash-based filenames to bust cache. Separate bundles for vendor and application code are created and referencing within the generated index.html file so that vendor libraries and app code can be cached separately by the browser. The bundle filenames are based on the file's hash, so the filenames only change when the file contents change. For more information on this, read [Long-term caching of static assets with Webpack](https://medium.com/@okonetchnikov/long-term-caching-of-static-assets-with-webpack-1ecb139adb95#.4aeatmtfz) and [html-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/ampedandwired/html-webpack-plugin)

### How is Sass being converted into CSS and landing in the browser?
Magic! Okay, more specifically, we're handling it differently in dev (`npm start`) vs prod (`npm run build`)

When you run `npm start`:

 1. The sass-loader compiles Sass into CSS
 2. Webpack bundles the compiled CSS into bundle.js. Sounds odd, but it works!
 3. bundle.js contains code that loads styles into the &lt;head&gt; of index.html via JavaScript. This is why you don't see a stylesheet reference in index.html. In fact, if you disable JavaScript in your browser, you'll see the styles don't load either.

The approach above supports hot reloading, which is great for development. However, it also create a flash of unstyled content on load because you have to wait for the JavaScript to parse and load styles before they're applied. So for the production build, we use a different approach:

When you run `npm run build`:

 1. The sass-loader compiles Sass into CSS
 2. The [extract-text-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/webpack/extract-text-webpack-plugin) extracts the compiled Sass into styles.css
 3. buildHtml.js adds a reference to the stylesheet to the head of index.html.

For both of the above methods, a separate sourcemap is generated for debugging Sass in [compatible browsers](http://thesassway.com/intermediate/using-source-maps-with-sass).


### How do I deploy this?
`npm run build`. This will build the project for production. It does the following:
* Minifies all JS
* Sets NODE_ENV to prod so that React is built in production mode
* Places the resulting built project files into /dist. (This is the folder you'll expose to the world).

### Why are test files placed alongside the file under test (instead of centralized)?
Streamlined automated testing is a core feature of this starter kit. All tests are placed in files that end in .spec.js. Spec files are placed in the same directory as the file under test. Why?
+ The existence of tests is highly visible. If a corresponding .spec file hasn't been created, it's obvious.
+ Easy to open since they're in the same folder as the file being tested.
+ Easy to create new test files when creating new source files.
+ Short import paths are easy to type and less brittle.
+ As files are moved, it's easy to move tests alongside.

That said, you can of course place your tests under /test instead, which is the Mocha default. If you do, you can simplify the test script to no longer specify the path. Then Mocha will simply look in /test to find your spec files.

### How do I debug?
Since browsers don't currently support ES6, we're using Babel to compile our ES6 down to ES5. This means the code that runs in the browser looks different than what we wrote. But good news, a [sourcemap](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/) is generated to enable easy debugging. This means your original JS source will be displayed in your browser's dev console.
*Note:* When you run `npm start`, no JS is minified. Why? Because minifying slows the build. So JS is only minified when you run the `npm run build` script. 

Also note that no actual physical files are written to the filesystem during the dev build. **For performance, all files exist in memory when served from the webpack server.**. Physical files are only written when you run `npm run build`.

**Tips for debugging via sourcemaps:**

 1. Browsers vary in the way they allow you to view the original source. Chrome automatically shows the original source if a sourcemap is available. Safari, in contrast, will display the minified source and you'll [have to cmd+click on a given line to be taken to the original source](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19550060/how-do-i-toggle-source-mapping-in-safari-7).  
 2. Do **not** enable serving files from your filesystem in Chrome dev tools. If you do, Chrome (and perhaps other browsers) may not show you the latest version of your code after you make a source code change. Instead **you must close the source view tab you were using and reopen it to see the updated source code**. It appears Chrome clings to the old sourcemap until you close and reopen the source view tab. To clarify, you don't have to close the actual tab that is displaying the app, just the tab in the console that's displaying the source file that you just changed.  
 3. If the latest source isn't displaying the console, force a refresh. Sometimes Chrome seems to hold onto a previous version of the sourcemap which will cause you to see stale code.


### Why does package.json reference the exact version?
This assures that the build won't break when some new version is released. Unfortunately, many package authors don't properly honor [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org), so instead, as new versions are released, I'll test them and then introduce them into the starter kit. But yes, this means when you do `npm update` no new dependencies will be pulled down. You'll have to update package.json with the new version manually.

### How do I handle images?
Via <a href="https://github.com/webpack/file-loader">Webpack's file loader</a>. Example: 

```
<img src={require('./src/images/myImage.jpg')} />

```

Webpack will then intelligently handle your image for you. For the production build, it will copy the physical file to /dist, give it a unique filename, and insert the appropriate path in your image tag.

### What about the Redux Devtools?
Install the [Redux devtools extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en) in Chrome Developer Tools. If you're interested in running Redux dev tools cross-browser

### How do I setup code coverage reporting?
Using the `npm run test:cover` command to run the tests, building a code coverage report. The report is written to `coverage/index.html`. A quick way to check coverage is:

```bash
npm run test:cover
open ./coverage/index.html
```
